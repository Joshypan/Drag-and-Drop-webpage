# Drag-and-Drop-webpage
This repo demonstrates a webpage that enables users to select multiple characters and one environment, this is used to create their Bikini Bottom environment. Once the environment is opened, you 
can drag and drop the characters anywhere on the page!
This was inspired by **"SpongeBob Squarepants"**
At the bottom of the main page, you will see a chart that contains all the progamming languages used to build this and where it was implemented.

ENJOY!
